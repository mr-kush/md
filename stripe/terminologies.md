## ðŸ§  Stripe Key Terminologies (With Examples)

---

### 1. **Platform**

> The business or application that integrates with Stripe to facilitate payments on behalf of others (e.g., a marketplace or SaaS product).

**Example:**
Your app "SkillHub" helps tutors get paid. SkillHub is the **platform** using Stripe Connect to pay tutors.

---

### 2. **Connected Account**

> A Stripe account (Express or Custom) linked to your platform to receive funds.

**Example:**
A tutor signs up on SkillHub and is created as a **connected account** using `accounts.create`.

---

### 3. **Charge**

> A successful payment made by a customer, tied to a PaymentIntent or a standalone `charge` object.

**Example:**
A student pays â‚¹1,000 for a tutoring session â†’ this becomes a **charge** with `status = succeeded`.

---

### 4. **Customer**

> A Stripe object that stores reusable payment methods, billing info, and subscriptions.

**Example:**
The student is created as a **Customer** object so their card can be reused for future payments.

---

### 5. **PaymentIntent**

> The core object in Stripeâ€™s modern payments API that tracks the entire lifecycle of a payment.

**Example:**
You create a `PaymentIntent` for â‚¹1,000 when a student checks out, and it tracks 3D Secure, success/failure, and final outcome.

---

### 6. **SetupIntent**

> Used to collect and save a payment method for future use (without charging now).

**Example:**
You save a parentâ€™s card to be used later for auto-pay in the future. You use a **SetupIntent**.

---

### 7. **Payment Method**

> A card, bank account, wallet, or any supported method to make payments.

**Example:**
Visa card, UPI, Klarna, or SEPA Direct Debitâ€”all are **payment methods**.

---

### 8. **Transfer**

> Movement of funds from your Stripe platform balance to a connected account.

**Example:**
You send â‚¹900 of the â‚¹1,000 charge to the tutorâ€™s **connected account** via a `transfer`.

---

### 9. **Payout**

> Movement of funds from a Stripe account to an external bank account.

**Example:**
The â‚¹900 in the tutorâ€™s connected account is sent to their bankâ€”this is a **payout**.

---

### 10. **Balance**

> The pool of available funds in a Stripe account, ready for transfers, payouts, or refunds.

**Example:**
Your platform receives â‚¹1,000 from a studentâ€”Stripe holds this in your **balance** until you transfer it.

---

### 11. **Webhook**

> A real-time notification from Stripe to your server when an event occurs (e.g., `payment_intent.succeeded`).

**Example:**
When a student pays successfully, a **webhook** hits your API to mark the class as confirmed.

---

### 12. **Product**

> A sellable item or service. Each product can have multiple prices.

**Example:**
"Math Tutoring" is a **Product**, with prices like â‚¹1,000/hour or â‚¹5,000/month.

---

### 13. **Price**

> The recurring or one-time cost of a product. Tied to billing frequency and amount.

**Example:**
â‚¹5,000/month for Math Tutoring is a **Price** object.

---

### 14. **Subscription**

### 18. **Radar**

> Stripeâ€™s fraud prevention tool that evaluates and blocks risky payments.

**Example:**
A payment from a stolen card is blocked by **Radar**, flagged as `highest_risk_level`.

---

### 19. **Dispute / Chargeback**

> A challenge from a customer claiming a charge was unauthorized or fraudulent.

**Example:**
The student says they didnâ€™t authorize the paymentâ€”this creates a **dispute** and Stripe deducts the amount temporarily.

---

### 20. **Refund**

**Example:**
The tutor cancels the class, so you initiate a **refund** on the original â‚¹1,000 charge.

---

### 21. **Destination Charge**
