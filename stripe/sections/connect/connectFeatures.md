### 3. **Flexible Funds Flow**

Stripe Connect supports various ways of moving money:

* **Direct Charges**: Payment goes directly to the connected account.
* **Destination Charges**: Platform collects the money, then routes a portion to the connected account.

### 4. **Application Fees & Revenue Sharing**

```json
"application_fee_amount": 1000  // take $10 on a $100 charge
```

This allows platforms to monetize transactions seamlessly.
