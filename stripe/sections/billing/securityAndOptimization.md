# 📈 Optimizing Authorization Rates & Securing Billing Integrations

Improving payment success and keeping subscriptions running smoothly requires optimizing **authorization rates** and securing your billing infrastructure.

---

## ✅ 1. Optimizing Authorization Rates

Stripe uses a combination of tools and logic to maximize the chance that a charge succeeds.

---

### 🔁 1.1 Smart Retries

Stripe automatically retries failed recurring payments using **machine learning** to optimize retry **timing** and **frequency**.

- Default behavior with Stripe Billing.
- Avoids retrying during likely failure windows (e.g., weekends, low bank availability).

**How to Enable:**

Smart Retries is automatically enabled when using:
- Subscriptions with `automatic_payment_methods`
- Payment Intents with retries allowed

---

### 💳 1.2 Automatic Card Updates

Stripe can automatically update **expired or replaced cards** via partnerships with networks (e.g., Visa, Mastercard).

- No extra setup needed.
- Reduces involuntary churn.
- Available with supported card networks and banks.

> Check Dashboard → Customers → Payment Methods to confirm updates.

---

### 🧠 1.3 Adaptive Retries (Stripe Logic)

Stripe uses data from past payments, geography, and issuer behavior to:

- Retry payments **intelligently**
- Avoid blocked attempts
- Time retries based on bank/issuer success patterns

> This logic is part of Stripe’s **Billing recovery tools**.

## 🔐 2. Integration Security Guide (for Billing)

When working with subscriptions, you must secure both **customer-facing** flows and **backend endpoints**.

---

### 🧑‍💼 2.1 Securing Customer Portals

Stripe offers a **hosted customer portal** that lets users manage subscriptions securely.

```bash
POST /v1/billing_portal/sessions
````

**Best Practices:**

* Require customer authentication before creating a session.
* Do not expose subscription or customer IDs directly on the client.
* Only allow access to the current user’s data.

---

### 🔐 2.2 Securing Subscription Endpoints

Endpoints that create or modify subscriptions should:

| Practice              | Description                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 🔒 Require Auth       | Use token-based or session-based auth |
| ✅ Validate Input      | Validate `price`, `customer_id`, etc. |
| 🚫 Prevent Overwrites | Use idempotency keys                  |
| 🕵️ Monitor Logs      | Track unusual usage patterns or abuse |

---

### 🚨 2.3 Common Vulnerabilities

* Users subscribing to **incorrect or free tiers**
* Manipulating `quantity` values
* Calling backend endpoints directly without auth
* Subscription cancellation spoofing

---

## 🧠 Developer Tips

* Use `idempotency_key` for all billing-related write operations
* Don’t trust values from the client (like plan IDs or prices)
* Log and monitor all subscription creation/update events
* Always test Smart Retries and billing flows in test mode

## 🧪 Testing Suggestions

| Scenario                                | Goal                         |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Payment fails, retried by Smart Retries | Verify recovery via ML logic |
| Expired card                            | Confirm automatic update     |
| Customer updates subscription           | Verify access is scoped      |
