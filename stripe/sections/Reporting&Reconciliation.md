‚úÖ Use this to verify **daily or monthly settlements** match what you actually received in your bank account.

| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |

| `fee`      | `fee_...`  | Stripe‚Äôs processing fee                    |
| `payout`   | `po_...`   | Money sent to your bank                    |
| `transfer` | `tr_...`   | Platform-to-account movement (for Connect) |
