When operating globally with Stripe, businesses face several key challenges:

| Challenge                    | Description                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Currency handling**        | Customers pay in one currency, businesses may want to settle in another (requires FX and multi-currency support) |
| **Regulatory compliance**    | Local laws (e.g. PSD2 in EU) require 3D Secure, verification, tax handling (VAT, GST), etc.                      |
| **Cross-border fees**        | Higher fees may apply for international cards and FX conversions                                                 |
| **Payment method diversity** | Preferred payment methods vary by region (e.g. SEPA in EU, ACH in US, Konbini in Japan)                          |
| **Identity verification**    | KYC/AML rules differ per country; more data is required as volume increases                                      |

### üí± 2. **Foreign Exchange (FX) & Currency Support**

Stripe supports **over 135 currencies**. You can:

* **Charge customers in their local currency** for better conversion.
* **Settle in your own currency** (Stripe will handle the conversion).

**FX fee:** Typically \~2% is applied on top of base processing fees when currency conversion occurs.

üîπ APIs like `balance_transaction`, `charge`, and `payout` return both original and converted amounts.

### üîÑ 3. **Cross-Border Transactions**

Cross-border payments occur when:

* The **card is issued in a different country** from the business.
* **Platform and connected accounts** are in different jurisdictions.

Risks/concerns:

* Higher decline rates.
* Need for **3D Secure (Strong Customer Authentication)**.
* Delays in **fund availability** due to AML checks.
* **Extra documentation** may be required for high-risk regions.

### üí≥ 4. **Common Regional Payment Methods**

| Region        | Common Methods                       |

### üõ°Ô∏è 5. **Integration Security Guide**

Stripe provides a comprehensive **[Integration Security Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/security/guide)** which covers:
