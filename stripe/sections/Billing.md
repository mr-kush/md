| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Flat-rate**             | \$10/month                                         |
| **Per-seat**              | \$10/user/month                                    |
| **Usage-based (metered)** | \$0.01 per API call                                |

### ‚úÖ **4. Optimizing Authorization Rates**

To **reduce declines** and **increase conversions**:

* Enable **automatic retries** on failed payments.
* Use **Smart Retries** (machine learning-based retry logic).
* Offer **multiple payment methods** (cards, wallets, bank debits).
* Use **Stripe Link** or **Payment Element** for one-click checkout.
* Collect full billing details for better risk scoring.

---

### ‚úÖ **5. Integration Security Guide**

* Use **Client + Server integration**:

  * Client: Collect PaymentMethod via Payment Element.
  * Server: Attach to customer, create Subscription or Invoice.
* Always **authenticate via API keys**, store minimal PII.
* Use **webhooks** to track subscription/invoice lifecycle (`invoice.paid`, `invoice.payment_failed`).
* Apply **idempotency keys** for subscription creation & invoice logic.
* Respect PCI compliance scope via Stripe Elements/Checkout.

---

### ‚úÖ **6. Upgrade & Downgrade Subscriptions**

Handled using:

* **`update subscription`** API.
* Stripe handles **proration** automatically:

  * Calculates unused time credit.
  * Applies charge for new plan tier.
* Can schedule changes via `SubscriptionSchedule`.
* Use `proration_behavior` parameter:

  * `create_prorations`, `none`, `always_invoice`.

Example (change plan):

```js
stripe.subscriptions.update('sub_123', {
  items: [{ id: 'si_456', price: 'price_new' }],
  proration_behavior: 'create_prorations',
});
```
