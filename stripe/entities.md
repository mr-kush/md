# Entities

Stripe uses various **entities** (or "objects") throughout its API and documentation to represent different components of the payment ecosystem. These entities are typically **JSON-based** data structures and are central to understanding how Stripe works.

> Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the **most important Stripe entities**, their purpose, and simple examples:

---

## üîπ 1. `Customer`

Represents a customer in your Stripe account. Can store payment methods, billing info, and subscriptions.

### üßæ Example:

```json
{
  "id": "cus_123abc",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "payment_methods": ["pm_1", "pm_2"]
}
```

---

## üîπ 2. `PaymentIntent`

Represents the lifecycle of a payment (especially for card-based and SCA-compliant payments).

### üßæ Example:

```json
{
  "id": "pi_1A2b3C4d5E",
  "amount": 2000,
  "currency": "usd",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "customer": "cus_123abc"
}
```

---

## üîπ 3. `SetupIntent`

Used to save a payment method for future use (without charging immediately).

### üßæ Example:

```json
{
  "id": "seti_123",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "payment_method": "pm_card_visa"
}
```

---

## üîπ 4. `Subscription`

Manages recurring billing for customers using Stripe Billing.

### üßæ Example:

```json
{
  "id": "sub_456",
  "customer": "cus_123abc",
  "items": [{ "price": "price_789" }],
  "status": "active"
}
```

---

## üîπ 5. `Invoice`

Represents a statement of amounts owed by a customer; generated for subscriptions or manual billing.

### üßæ Example:

```json
{
  "id": "in_123",
  "amount_due": 1000,
  "status": "open",
  "customer": "cus_123abc"
}
```

---

## üîπ 6. `Charge`

Represents a single attempt to move money from a customer‚Äôs payment method.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Stripe recommends using `PaymentIntent` instead for newer integrations.

  "id": "ch_123",
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "usd",
  "status": "succeeded"
}
```

  "amount": 5000,
  "currency": "usd",
  "destination": "ba_456"
}
```

---

## üîπ 8. `BalanceTransaction`

Describes any transaction that affects the Stripe balance (charges, payouts, refunds, etc.)

### üßæ Example:

```json
{
  "id": "txn_789",
  "amount": 1000,
  "type": "charge",
  "net": 970,
  "fee": 30
}
```

## üîπ 9. `Product` & `Price`

* **Product**: An item or service you're selling.
* **Price**: Defines the cost and billing frequency.

### üßæ Example:

  "type": "custom",
  "email": "seller@example.com"
}
```

---

## üîπ 11. `WebhookEvent`

## üß† Tips for Studying These Entities

* Think of entities as **API building blocks** ‚Äî most API calls return or expect one of these objects.
* Stripe‚Äôs **API reference** lists each entity with parameters, responses, and links between them.
* Use Stripe‚Äôs [API Explorer](https://stripe.com/docs/api) to see live examples.
